# broker-sftp-interface [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=aktin_broker-sftp-interface&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=aktin_broker-sftp-interface) ![example workflow](https://github.com/aktin/broker-sftp-interface/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)
Simple script that filters all [AKTIN Broker](https://github.com/aktin/broker) requests by a given tag and uploads the results of the filtered requests to a specified FTP server.

Remembers the uploaded results via a created XML file that stores the request ID and the completeness of the uploaded results. Matches the completeness of broker requests with the XML file before uploading to the FTP server and uploads only new/changed results.

Script->> Broker: Give me the IDs of all requests with this tag
Broker--x Script: Here you go
Script->> Script: Let's compare them with what I have written down
Script->> Broker: Some IDs are new, get me the results
Broker--x Script: Alright
Script->> FTP: I have new results for you
FTP--x Script: Good
Script->> Script: Better write down, what results I just gave him
```

## Testing

For testing the script, **test.py** is attached. To run the test script, a running instance of the AKTIN broker-server is needed. Preferably via the [broker-admin-dist](https://github.com/aktin/broker/tree/master/broker-admin-dist) package, but [broker-docker](https://github.com/aktin/broker/tree/master/docker) should work as well.

Prior testing, broker requests are needed to be created on the broker-server. The content of the requests is irrelevant, it is only important that a tag is set for each request. The easiest way to create broker requests is to use the view of the broker-server. The default credentials are as following:

	url: http://localhost:8080/admin/html/login.html
	user: admin
	password: CHANGME

Furthermore, a running instance of an FTP server is required. During development [bogem/ftp](https://hub.docker.com/r/bogem/ftp) was used.

Finally, enter the information about the broker and the FTP server in  **ftp_export.py**

    BROKER_URL = 'localhost:8080'
    ADMIN_API_KEY = 'xxxAdmin1234'

    FTP_IP = '127.0.0.1'
    FTP_PORT = 21
    FTP_USERNAME = 'username'
    FTP_PASSWORD = 'password'






## Setup SFTP Server Ubuntu

sudo passwd sftpuser


sudo mkdir -p /var/sftp/rki
sudo chown root:root /var/sftp
sudo chmod 755 /var/sftp
sudo chown ftpuser:sftp /var/sftp/rki

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Port 22
Match User sftpuser
ForceCommand internal-sftp
PasswordAuthentication yes
ChrootDirectory /var/sftp
PermitTunnel no
